Semester Project 1 Report

The brief for this semester project was to make an interactive science museum called the Community Science Museum. The target audience for this website is primary and middle school children between the age of seven and fifteen. Families with young children too. The goal for this website was to make an informative and appealing website to attract school children and families. Although the museums core target audience is youngsters, the site should take for granted that the audience is intelligent. The website should make the viewers want to visit the museum and it should be informative and engaging.
I was provided with media assets to use in my site such as text and images. I made a website with six pages. The six pages are following:
- Home page
- Tickets page
- Explore page
- Contact page
- About page
- Order page

In regards of the target audience being of young age, I choose an image of a boy in a museum as my hero image for the home page. I made ticket cards for the exhibitions and events the museum have. Choice of color for these cards was based on the image color of each cards. I chose different type of colors on each of my ticket cards. It gives a good mixture of both children and parents visiting the site. The colours makes the tickets more eye-catching for the target audience while the event and exhibition info make sure that the audience is intelligent. All images on the home page is from the zip file except the hero image and Robotics & AI card image. When you click on Tickets Available button on the cards, it leads you to the tickets page. Here you write name and email, choose which exhibition/event you want to visit and also how many adults and children that’s coming. I used ´label´ and ´input´ tags for name and email and ´select´ and ´option´ tags for option alternatives such as exhibition/event, adult and child. When you click on the ´Get Tickets Now´ button you get sent to the next page which is the order confirmation page. Here you find some details about your order. To make it a bit professional I made kind of a real ticket for the exhibition/event that’s been ordered with a QR code for it. If you scan the QR code, it will take you to your ticket. Reason behind choosing the same image for my tickets page and order page is because that’s kind of the museum the buyer is going to visit.

On my explore page I choose an image that I felt fit in perfect. This site has information for kids, teachers and researches. The hero image for this page shows a boy and a girl on an exhibition ´exploring together´. Between the teacher and researcher information I choose the image with an old man standing with his back to the camera since it is between information for the elders.
For my contact page I used ´label´ and ´input´ tags same as on the ticket page. Since it is a contact page I choose a call center image. Here you can write your name, email and send your message. You can also sign up for information and news.
On my about page I have information about us, support and opening hours for the museum. The hero image on this page is a skeleton head at an exhibition, this kind of shows the inside of the museum.
I made four types of media queries for each page.

The choice of header and footer color was made from the site logos colours. The logo shows an atom with colours of green and black so I choose a linear gradient type of these colours. Above the footer I made a section with information to make it look a bit professional. Her you can find contact and about page, where the museum is located, what purpose this site was made for, what payments the site accept and where to find us on social media.

All images used for this site is from the zip file except so. I will put the link from where I got these images down below. Also the link for my ticket that I made.

For the iPhone 5/SE wireframe I coded the home logo and navigations in a section inside the header and made two div inside the main section. The plan was to code it with display flex and make the direction row on bigger screens but as I started working on the media queries I found it a bit difficult to make the header responsive for all screen sizes. I applied gap between the row and it kept messing with some breakpoints. It then led me to make it columns on desktop version as well. The same goes for my section above the footer.
